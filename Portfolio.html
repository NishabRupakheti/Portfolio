            Hello, I'm Nishab Rupakheti, a dedicated individual hailing from the beautiful country of Nepal. Currently,
            I am immersed in my academic journey at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
            Information and Communication Technology. My decision to study in Europe stems from a longstanding
            fascination with European culture and admiration for its educational systems.

            My academic pursuits are fueled by a profound passion for technology, and I am enthusiastic about delving
            into diverse realms within the field of computer sciences. Eager to explore the ever-evolving landscape of
            technology, I am committed to acquiring knowledge and skills that will not only contribute to my personal
            growth but also enable me to make meaningful contributions to the world of information and communication
            technology.
